            <p class="content">I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and currently live in Oakland near the Zoo.  Both of my parents are first generation American from the former country of Czechoslovakia.  While I can speak fluent Slovak I cannot read or write it.  I attended and graduated from California High School in San Ramon, CA with honors in 1993 then went on to pursue a Computer Science Engineering degree at the Univeristy of California at San Diego in La Jolla, CA.  After graduating in 1999 I spent over 3 months travelling across 16 European Countries and even spent some time with my family in Slovakia for 2 1/2 weeks.  Once I returned stateside I accepted an offer from McKesson as an Interface Engineer and never got to hone my skills as a software developer.  My job was pretty simple, to move patient data like demographics, scheduling, billing, orders and lab results from one medical system to another, built by different vendors.  This required me to learn the world of HL7, an international standard for the electronic transmission of Health related information.  I've been with the company for 19 years now and just recently accepted a junior developer position - hence my presence in the UC Berekley extension Coding Bootcamp program.  I will be working with 2 other Senior Developers on our Lynx drug dispensing system which is coded in Java version 8.  Most of the Jira tickets assigned to me are front end fixes to our Java Server Pages or .JSP files. </p>
